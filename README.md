## Download 🖨️
- Download pre-compiled exe from [Releases](https://github.com/alesbe/sorting-visualizer/releases). <br>
**Note: The libraries are static, so they are all included in a single exe, in my case Windows detects this as something dangerous im not sure why, but you are free to compile the project yourself using the other options.**
- Compile the project using the Visual Studio solution.
- Compile the code yourself (if you have any SFML library related issue, follow [this](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) guide).
