## üìñ I want to contribute to the project!
Awesome! [Here](https://github.com/alesbe/sorting-visualizer/wiki) you can find some useful info about the visualizer, we accept first contributors too!

*Also, make sure to pull the last changes from [dev](https://github.com/alesbe/sorting-visualizer/tree/dev) branch!*

## üóÇÔ∏è Sort types
- **Bubble sort**
  - Bubble sort works by continuously swapping elements next to each other that are in the wrong place. Starting from the beginning of the dataset, each element 'floats' to its correct spot. More on Bubble sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/).
- **Selection sort**
  - Selection sort works by having two sections, the sorted and unsorted sections, and continuously search through the unsorted section and place the smallest element into the sorted section. This sorting algorithm could be implemented where the largest element is selected instead. More on selection sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/).
- **Insertion sort**
  - Insertion sort is similar to selection sort in that they both have a sorted and unsorted section. Instead of continuously selected the smallest/largest element, it will insert a selected element from the unsorted portion and 'insert' it into the correct spot in the sorted section. More on insertion sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/).
- **Quick sort**
  - Quick sort is a "Divide and Conquer" algorithm. Divide and Conquer algorithms work by splitting the problem into smaller portions, solving the smaller problems, then combing the solutions into one final solution. Quick sort works by choosing an element as a 'pivot', moving the other elements around where elements less than the pivot are on one side and elements greater than the pivot are on the other, then continuously doing that process with each side. Once each element has been partitioned, the solution is combined into the sorted array. More on quick sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/) and more on Divide and Conquer algorithms can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-divide-and-conquer-algorithm-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/).
- **Cocktail shaker sort**
  - Cocktail shaker sort is a variant of Bubble Sort. Instead of only having elements 'float' from the bottom to its correct spot in the dataset, elements also 'sink' from the top of the datset into its correct position. More on cocktail shaker sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cocktail-sort/).
- **Bogo sort**
  - Bogo sort is an inefficient sorting algorithm where it randomly generates different versions of the original dataset and checks if it's sorted or not. More on bogo sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bogosort-permutation-sort/).
- **Bitonic sort**
  - Bitonic sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm that can be run with parallel implementation. Within different subarrays, the algorithm checks if the first element is smaller than the second and vice versa. It continuously does that on larger subarrays until the whole dataset is sorted. More on bitonic sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitonic-sort/).
- **Odd-Even sort**
  - Odd-Even sort is comparassion vased sorting algorithm developed for use on pararell processors, its based on bubble sort but is divided into two phases Odd and Even Phase. On Odd phase algorithm performs bubble sort on odd indexed elements, during even phase on even indexed elements. More on Odd-Even sort can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/odd-even-sort-brick-sort/).

## üñ®Ô∏è Download
**Requirements:**
- CMake

### üêß Linux
- Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/alesbe/sorting-visualizer && cd sorting-visualizer`
- Run `./install.sh`

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows / MacOS
#### [Download from releases](https://github.com/alesbe/sorting-visualizer/releases/)

If you want to compile the project by yourself you need to follow the next steps:
1. Download SFML from the [official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/)
2. Download [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
3. Clone the repository
4. Open `CMakeLists.txt` and locate the variable `SFML_DIR`. Set the path to the route where the SFML CMake files are located. For instance `C:/Program Files (x86)/SFML/lib/cmake/SFML`.
5. From the root directory of the repository, run:
```
mkdir build cd build
cmake ..
cmake -G 'Visual Studio 17 2022' ..
```
6. In the `/build` directory should be a Visual Studio solution. Now you can open the solution and compile the file with the play button as usual!

_Note: If you don't want to use Visual Studio 2022, download SFML for your target compiler and change the cmake generator in step 6. You can check the list of generators with cmake -G_
